                    <br>
                    <p class="mb-0">From the very first day we came into the Hotel to enquire about holding our wedding there, when we met you Gemma, your easy, charming, professional approach made it an easy decision to take - that and the fantastic location of course - your continued prompt responses to our queries were always appreciated, and a thanks must go to Amy on the reception too. And when we got to meet you Ben in January, the friendly, charming and professional service continued, we were both put at ease all the way through the sometimes stressful moments, and your smile never really left your face even when we slightly overran with the speeches! Thanks to the chef and his team too, lovely food, served by great waiting staff (also at breakfast too). We would also like to give a special mention to Alin who we met this weekend, he was fab and so helpful right through the weekend, nothing was too much trouble - a theme that really applies to all the staff we met from housekeeping, workers out in the grounds and to all the bar staff including the night manager - A great testament to you in the management of the Hotel.

                    <p class="mb-0">I’ve been photographing weddings at Raven Hall for 16 years and it remains my favourite venue to visit. From the friendliest staff to the unrivalled views across the bay, from the delicious food to the elegant George III suite, it is without question the leading wedding venue on the Yorkshire coast. Staff are always polite, professional and kind, I have seen countless times that nothing is too much trouble - weddings at Raven Hall always run smoothly because of this and many of my couples comment on the staff, particularly Gemma and Ben. The views across the bay are magnificent especially on perfect summer days and for the sunsets. As well as photographing weddings at Raven Hall, I’ve visited many times for family meals and stayed overnight on several occasions and our experience has always been excellent: delicious food and the first class accommodation. I whole-heartedly recommend Raven Hall and urge any couples looking to get married to check out this outstanding venue.

                    <br>
                    <p class="mb-0">We had the most perfect wedding at Raven Hall and we cannot get over how helpful the staff and the whole Raven Hall team were, the food was simply superb, we’ve had many guests compliment the food and the venue itself. I haven’t heard a single complaint. All of the staff were extremely accommodating to our needs and requests. Even the days after our wedding the staff were so helpful asking how our day was and attending to our needs (we stayed a few extra nights after) Gemma and Ben could not do enough for us and any question we had they came back to us pretty quickly. On the wedding day Ben was incredible ensuring everyone was on time and there were no hiccups! Raven Hall will always be a huge part of our life especially after visiting here for the 11 years that we’ve been together and now getting married here.
